Since returning to The People's Republic, my monthlies have decided it is time to have
I pay back for how breezily they had been since my beginning.

Absolutely to brag, I rarely took any pain killers (Ibuprophen, Naproxen, Midol, etc)
 or supplements (coffee, TCM, etc); I never gave a hot water bottle a try, or spent the day in bed.
PSM wasn't a bother either until I went WWOOF-ing in the Canadian Maritimes. But everything 
changed as I kept traveling to and from China. Each trip welcomes a new souvenir. First cramps,
 then cravings started, then heavier flow, then nausea, and finally anger and emotions have started. 
 Nowadays, I even have cramps for ovulation. 

Over the years, I've taken keenly to trying new methods and products. Many brands of pads and disposable tampons,
 disposable soft cups, the less wasteful OB tampons, Diva Cup, 
Lunapads (for either light or they are panty liners), and the wonderful Athena Cup.

I wanted tampons because pads were too noticeable for school. 
		Mum introduced me to paper packaging tampies. 
I would have plastic ones too on occasion because they stayed wrapped in backpacks. 
		The plastic felt wasteful, so I put paper-packaged tampons in a baggie in my bag. Problem solved.
I found pads with extra wings at TNT (Asian supermarket), which became my lazy day go-to. They're great for sleeping on your back.
I wanted OB tampons because the packaging of other tampons felt wasteful.
		Loved them. Still keep some in case I drop my cup. 
I tried Diva Cup but left it in my jacket in a friend's trunk. Took months to find, and by then I had already fallen for cups, so I bought the Athena Cup. 
		Cup on most days, pad on the really heavy day. Too annoying to empty the cup every hour or so.  If I must go out, this day gets a cup and pad combo.
		Liked the Athena Cup more, as it is made from a softer silicone. But after 4 years of use, it looks like it is time to replace it.

Over the past year, I have started using pads again. I am not happy with this, so I decided that it was time to give reusable pads a try. Maybe even period undies. They seem lovely.


Day 1 - Garmin and Clue say my period should start tomorrow. Lunapad in case bleeding starts overnight. It didn't.
Day 2 - Lunapad,
